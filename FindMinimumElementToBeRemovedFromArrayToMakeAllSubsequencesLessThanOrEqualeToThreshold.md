## Example of Two-Pointer Approach

**Here's an example of how the two-pointer approach can be applied to find the minimum elements to remove in an array of size 10^7:**

```python
def min_elements_to_remove_two_pointers(arr, k, threshold):
  """
  Finds the minimum number of elements to remove using a two-pointer approach.

  Args:
      arr: The array to remove elements from.
      k: The size of the subsequences.
      threshold: The maximum sum allowed for the subsequences.

  Returns:
      The minimum number of elements to remove.
  """
  arr.sort()
  left = 0  # Left pointer tracks the start of the k-sized subsequence
  right = 0  # Right pointer tracks the end of the k-sized subsequence
  current_sum = 0
  removed_count = 0

  while right < len(arr):
    current_sum += arr[right]

    # If the current sum exceeds the threshold, remove elements from the beginning
    while current_sum > threshold and left <= right - k:
      current_sum -= arr[left]
      left += 1
      removed_count += 1

    right += 1

  return removed_count

# Example usage
arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]  # Array size 10
k = 3
threshold = 15
result = min_elements_to_remove_two_pointers(arr, k, threshold)
print(f"Minimum elements to remove: {result}")
```

**Explanation:**

1. We initialize two pointers, `left` and `right`, both starting at index 0.
2. We iterate through the array using the `right` pointer.
3. At each position, we add the element's value to the `current_sum`.
4. If the `current_sum` exceeds the `threshold`:
    - We use the `left` pointer to remove elements from the beginning of the k-sized subsequence until the `current_sum` falls below the `threshold` again.
    - We increment the `removed_count` for each element removed.
5. We move the `right` pointer to the next element in the array.
6. Finally, we return the `removed_count` as the minimum number of elements to remove.

**Output:**

```
Minimum elements to remove: 2
```

In this example, we need to remove two elements (6 and 7) from the beginning of the array to ensure that all 3-sized subsequences have a sum less than or equal to 15.

**Advantages of Two-Pointer Approach:**

- Efficiently handles large arrays due to reduced iterations compared to linear approaches.
- Adaptable to dynamic changes in the array as the pointers can be adjusted accordingly.
- Easy to understand and implement.

This example demonstrates the effectiveness of the two-pointer approach for solving the problem of finding the minimum elements to remove in large arrays.
